# C33 toolchain handoff

This is the current operational summary for the C33 toolchain, firmware
build, emulator validation, and remaining work. Detailed ABI rules live in
[`gcc/ABI.md`](gcc/ABI.md); test invocation lives in
[`tests/dejagnu/README.md`](tests/dejagnu/README.md).

## Goal

Replace EPSON's binutils 2.10.1 / GCC 3.3.2 toolchain with binutils 2.47 and
GCC 16.2 while retaining the S1C33E07 PE ABI and the ability to build and run
the complete WikiReader firmware.

## Current status

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| binutils 2.47 | Assembler, linker, BFD, objdump, readelf, CTF, plugins, relocations, and all three C33 core modes work. Exact-source gas/binutils/ld suites have no unexpected failures. |
| GCC 16.2 | Builds the kernel, boot applications, `init.app`, and `wiki.app`; short/long calls, delay slots, `%r15` data addressing, strict alignment, soft-float, variadic forwarding, sibling calls, trampolines, and three core multilibs are implemented. Bit-memory operands are restricted to the base-plus-constant forms the ISA can encode. |
| ABI | New and original objects cross-call in all four compiler combinations and agree at five optimization levels. |
| Firmware | A current full FLASH boot reaches the UI, search results, articles, and scrolling. Modern and shipped firmware render matching screens for the tested workloads. Grifo uses FatFs R0.16 with FAT32/exFAT, multiple volumes, compact fast-seek maps, and 64-bit file positions. |
| Emulator | The manual-derived ISA, exceptions, interrupts, clocks, SDRAM, SPI, SD card, DMA, LCD, ADC, watchdog, timer, port, and chip-ID models pass `make check`. |
| DejaGnu | The standard GCC board is authoritative. Focused execution suites are clean; the final post-fix unfiltered run is still pending. |

There is no known wrong-code failure in a supported C or ABI feature. The
remaining unexpected focused results are target-dependent scan or diagnostic
expectations, not malformed code; they remain visible in
[`tests/DEJAGNU-TODO.md`](tests/DEJAGNU-TODO.md).

## Build

Keep binutils and GCC in the same prefix:

```sh
# From the repository root.
host-tools/toolchain-c33/binutils/build.sh host-tools/toolchain-c33/work
host-tools/toolchain-c33/gcc/rebuild.sh
```

The installed tools are under:

```text
host-tools/toolchain-c33/work/install/bin/c33-epson-elf-*
```

`gcc/rebuild.sh` is the normal GCC build. It rebuilds and installs `libgcc`
instead of trusting incremental target-library stamps.

Firmware Makefiles still default to the original compiler. Always select the
modern prefix explicitly:

```sh
make TOOLCHAIN_BIN="$(pwd)/host-tools/toolchain-c33/work/install/bin" <target>
```

Do not mix objects or archives from the two compilers in an incremental
firmware build. Clean the affected component when changing compiler,
optimization level, ABI code, or multilib.

The shipped compiler remains available as an ABI and assembler oracle:

```sh
make toolchain
# installs under host-tools/toolchain-install/bin
```

## Validation

### binutils

The modern assembler matches the original for all comparable code and data:

- 86 hand-written assembly files match in `.text`, `.data`, relocations, and
  ELF C33/core identification;
- 143 original-GCC assembly outputs match in `.text`;
- 20 local relocations differ only in modernized symbol representation and
  produce identical linked code; and
- the current exact-source suites report 338 gas passes, 240 binutils passes,
  and 479 ld passes with zero unexpected failures.

Run the oracle comparison with:

```sh
host-tools/toolchain-c33/tools/compare-with-oracle.sh
```

### GCC and ABI

- `gcc.c-torture/execute`: 24,260 passes, 251 legitimate unsupported results,
  zero failures or unresolved cases across all 1,692 sources and standard
  option variants.
- `gcc.dg/torture` and IPA: no demonstrated backend failure remains.
- LTO: 1,651 passes, 34 external-prerequisite unsupported results, zero
  failures or unresolved cases.
- ABI cross-linking: all four old/new caller/callee combinations agree.
- Differential execution: 200 generated programs per compiler across
  `-O0`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`, and `-Os` match native reference results.
- The focused C33 target directory reports 408 expected passes and four
  unsupported results, including the indexed bit-memory reload regression.

Useful focused checks:

```sh
host-tools/toolchain-c33/tests/abi/run-abi.sh
cd host-tools/toolchain-c33/tests/dejagnu
./run-dejagnu.sh execute execute.exp=pr61725.c
./run-dejagnu.sh gcc.dg dg.exp=20010516-1.c
```

### Firmware and DMA benchmark

`SD_DMA=YES` is the kernel default. `SD_DMA=NO` retains the same MMC code but
uses its PIO payload loop, providing a matched benchmark build.

The first stable screen is governed by a deliberate two-second deadline:

| Firmware | Modeled time | Executed work |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| shipped GCC 3.3.2, PIO | 2363.4 ms | 61,364,514 |
| GCC 16.2, PIO | 2370.6 ms | 56,406,351 |
| GCC 16.2, DMA | 2374.3 ms | 40,340,531 |

DMA reduces work by 28.5% there, but the fixed deadline converts the saving
to idle time. Before that wait, the first wiki `File_initialise` occurs at
905.9 ms, 893.6 ms, and 773.0 ms respectively.

The better sustained-I/O measurement opens the first result for `LOVE`. Both
modern paths read the same 395 blocks:

| Kernel path | Article data and LZMA | Executed work |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| PIO | 3831.4 ms | 64,395,028 |
| DMA | 3629.3 ms | 55,589,491 |

DMA saves 202.1 modeled ms (5.3%) and 13.7% of executed instructions. Final
framebuffers are byte-identical. Milliseconds are predictions from the 60 MHz
MCLK, SPI, DMA, and SDRAM models; real hardware must calibrate absolute card
latency and cross-bank SDRAM overlap.

The production DMA backend waits in HALT for HSDMA3 terminal count instead of
polling its enable bit. A fixed 300-million-cycle boot/search/article run drops
from 160,069,719 to 151,391,234 executed instructions and from 6094.8 to
6015.4 modeled ms. Both paths read 915 blocks, perform identical DMA transfers,
and render identical screens.

The pre-kernel MBR/menu/file-loader still reads by PIO. Kernel block reads use
DMA; card writes remain PIO. The file-loader fits A0 with 371 bytes of live
headroom. The menu is tighter: its BSS ends 18 bytes below the end of A0.

The ZIM reader uses Grifo's FatFs service rather than parsing a filesystem
itself. Its preferred card layout keeps the boot chain on a small FAT32 first
partition and stores `wiki.zim` on a second exFAT partition. A contiguous
exFAT file produces its 16-byte seek map directly from filesystem metadata;
fragmented files still use FatFs's normal chain traversal. The existing
single-volume FAT32 layout remains a fallback for archives below 4 GiB.

The current contiguous 944 MiB archive has been tested through full FLASH
boot, prefix search, and article rendering. With current binaries, direct
Grifo boot reaches the ZIM parser at 667.9 modeled ms from exFAT versus 1793.5
ms from FAT32; the latter reads 1,889 FAT sectors to construct its seek map.
The 64-bit path also opens a 4.5 GiB exFAT test archive whose live path index
was relocated to byte 4,300,000,000, proving an actual seek and read above the
4 GiB boundary. `zim/make-card-image` creates the dual-volume image on macOS.

### GCC 16 optimization benchmark

A clean full-FLASH `LOVE` search/article A/B rebuilt the complete runtime stack
(`kernel.elf`, `init.app`, and `wiki.app`) at either `-O2` or `-Os`. The A0
MBR/menu/file-loader remained at their required `-Os` in both images. Each run
repeated exactly, and the final framebuffers have the same SHA-256 digest.

| Metric | `-O2` | `-Os` | `-Os` change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| installed runtime files | 215,172 B | 195,664 B | -9.1% |
| reset to wiki main loop | 786.7 ms | 798.3 ms | +1.5% |
| article interval, instructions | 55,588,282 | 52,724,316 | -5.2% |
| article interval, modeled time | 3680.09 ms | 3796.75 ms | +3.2% |
| reset to article completion, instructions | 136,677,103 | 132,298,914 | -3.2% |
| reset to article completion, modeled time | 11860.6 ms | 12057.8 ms | +1.7% |
| modeled SDRAM wait cycles | 343,337,791 | 361,692,295 | +5.3% |

Keep `-O2` as the runtime default. On the current model, `-Os` executes less
code but loses more time to SDRAM/bus stalls. This is a medium-confidence
ordering, not a hardware measurement: absolute SD latency and conservative
cross-bank overlap still need physical calibration.

## Known boundaries

### Toolchain feature debt

- `__int128` needs a C33 ABI, TImode lowering, and libgcc helpers.
- Atomics need a target concurrency model and libatomic; C33 has no native
  compare-and-swap and this toolchain is single-threaded.
- GCC heap trampolines need allocator and executable-memory runtime hooks.
- Full debugger use has not been qualified. DWARF line tables and ordinary
  `.debug_info` are valid, but production firmware is stripped.
- Darwin intentional-crash, SARIF, and diagnostic-path cases need a focused
  host-integration audit.

### External runtime prerequisites

These are not GCC/binutils correctness bugs and require separate approval:

- C99 libm and floating-point `printf`;
- hosted file, environment, time, signal, and process APIs;
- persistent gcov output and `__gcov_exit` transport;
- sanitizer runtimes;
- crt iteration of constructor/destructor arrays; and
- semihosting, persistent host files, or a thread/TLS runtime.

### Emulator boundaries

- The SDRAM model serializes cross-bank command/data phases conservatively.
- Absolute SD-card response latency needs measurement on a real device.
- Firmware plus differential tests execute 57 of 74 implemented PE
  operations; focused core tests cover most of the remainder. Targeted
  independent coverage of stack-special and indirect-jump forms is still
  useful.
- Illegal delay-slot behavior has no unstable-state model.
- Coprocessor instructions are intentionally absent because the S1C33E07 has
  no attached coprocessor.
- Unused alternate pins, timer output modes, DMA triggers, and the RTC are not
  implementation priorities unless WikiReader firmware begins using them.

## Next work

1. Make modern-vs-legacy firmware toolchain selection explicit and resistant
   to stale mixed objects.
2. Add targeted independent runtime coverage for the implemented PE
   operations not reached by firmware or differential programs.
3. Exercise an unstripped C33 program with a real debugger and verify
   stepping, frames, arguments, and variables.
4. Automate the stock/modern/PIO/DMA card-image benchmark.
5. Refine documented cross-bank SDRAM overlap; keep absolute timing claims
   conditional on hardware calibration.
6. Run the complete post-fix DejaGnu suite when the multi-hour validation is
   wanted, then treat its fresh failures as the only broad-suite backlog.
7. Add link-time A0 size assertions, especially for the menu.
8. Exercise the ZIM reader with a complete full-English archive and replace
   its fixed 512 KiB decoded-article buffer if real articles exceed it.
